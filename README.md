## Introduction

Banks in modern day Philippines typically tailor their services in order to meet the specific needs of their different customer groups. However, addressing the unique preferences of the multitude of characteristics of the customers in the country remains a huge challenge.

This project attempts to cluster BPI credit card users using data provided by BPI. Nine datasets were provided, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted on all of them to gain useful insights and to determine which parts of the data to consider in the clustering process.

## Methods

### Data Preparation

- Extracted each dataset.
- Applied cleaning and filtering: removal of duplicate entries, renaming of columns, and removal of null values.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Rendered univariate plots (histograms, bar charts, pie charts) to understand demographics and spending distributions.
- Conducted bivariate analysis using boxplots, scatterplots, and bar plots to present relationships between two variables.
- Created multivariate analyses including scatterplots, box plots, 3D plots, and Pearson correlation heatmaps.
- Plotted mean and median plots and removed null values where necessary.

### Feature Engineering

- Added Recency, Frequency, and Monetary features for RFM analysis.
- Converted categorical features into numerical ones:
  - One-Hot Encoding for: `BUSINESS_OWNER`, `DIGITAL_FLAG`, `INCOME_SOURCE`, `IDV_OR_ORG`, `GENDER`, `MARITAL_STATUS`.
  - Label Encoding for ordinal features: `EDUCATION`, `REGION`, `SUBSEGMENT` (Sethi, 2023).
- Applied logarithmic transformation to reduce right-skewness and the impact of outliers (preferred by K-Means).
- Standardized features using `StandardScaler` so all features are on the same scale (Ryzhkov, 2020).

### Clustering

- Algorithm used: **K-Means** with **PCA** for dimensionality reduction.
- Decided to retain **25 features** based on explained variance ratio.

---

## Results

- Explained Variance Ratio was used to select components; 25 features retained.
- Cluster validation:
  - Elbow method suggests a large number of clusters.
  - Silhouette scores were low (approximately 0.11â€“0.24), indicating clusters are not very well separated.

## Discussion

*(Content was present in the original document but left visually sparse. Consider adding interpretation of clusters, characteristics of each cluster, business implications, and recommended next steps.)*

## Appendix

### Changes Made

- Cluster validation techniques were added.
- Graphs showing characteristics of the target segment were added.
